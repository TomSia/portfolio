# PORTFOLIO PROJECT ONE

This is a website which I created for my brand Tomsia Developments by using HTML and CSS to produce my portfolio for Project 1, This website was made to
display my portfolio/work for people who are interested to look at, Users will use my website to check out my work and see my skills in Front end development.

## UX

My website is used as my own portfolio so I've chosen a color scheme which matches my logo which is gold gray and white and this color scheme follows through the entire website
this makes the website much cleaner to look at and scroll through I've chosen this color scheme to display a bit of luxury and relaxation towards my website.

I've chosen to style my website a bit more modernised to display that I'm up to date with all the new trends and minimalistic world we have right now.

## Challenges

Some challenges I faced were:

- Add future projects, which I dont have any at the moment.

## Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Loaded the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace.
2. Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
3. Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the `git add .` command.
4. Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m "Initial commit"` command.
5. Created a new repository in GitHub called 'Portfolio'.
6. Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace:

    ```git remote add origin https://github.com/TomSia/portfolio.git```

    ```git push -u origin master```

7. Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.
8. Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.
9. Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.
10. Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
